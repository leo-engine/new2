The Four Main Conditionals:

    Zero Conditional: For general truths or facts (if + present simple, present simple).

    First Conditional: For real and possible future events (if + present simple, will + base verb).

    Second Conditional: For unreal or hypothetical present or future situations (if + past simple, would + base verb).

    Third Conditional: For unreal or hypothetical past situations (if + past perfect, would have + past participle).

"What's the first thing you'd do if you left this room?"
This sentence uses the second conditional structure, which is used for hypothetical or unreal situations in the present or future.
The pattern is:
If + past tense (left), would + base verb (do).
So, "if you left this room" matches correctly with "you'd do" (you would do).

-------------third conditional in English grammar. It is used to talk about hypothetical or unreal situations in the past—things that did not happen—and to imagine their possible past results.
Third Conditional Structure
    If + past perfect (e.g., "If I had studied")
    Main clause: would have + past participle (e.g., "I would have passed")
